### Basic writing and formatting syntax of the README.md

See link [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/).
Or see that one - [Markdown: Syntax](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#backslash).

## Ignoring Markdown formatting

You can tell GitHub to ignore (or escape) Markdown formatting by using '\' before the Markdown character.


## Headings

To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the size of the heading. 
\# Heading 
# Heading 

## Styling text

You can indicate emphasis with bold, italic, or strikethrough text:

bold \**some text\** or \__some text\__ - **some text**

italic \*some text\* or \_some text\_ - *some text*

strikethrough \~~some text\~~ - ~~some text~~

## Quoting text

You can quote text with a >.

\> Pardon my French
> Pardon my French


## Quoting code

You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks. The text within the backticks will not be formatted.

\```
git status
git add
git commit
\```
```
git status
git add
git commit
```

## Links

You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ).

This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Lists

You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with - or *.

- George Washington
- John Adams
- Thomas Jefferson

# Nested Lists

You can create a nested list by indenting one or more list items below another item.

To create a nested list using the web editor on GitHub or a text editor that uses a monospaced font, like Atom, you can align your list visually. Type space characters in front of your nested list item, until the list marker character (- or *) lies directly below the first character of the text in the item above it.

## Task lists

To create a task list, preface list items with [ ]. To mark a task as complete, use [x].

- [x] Finish my changes
- [ ] Push my commits to GitHub
- [ ] Open a pull request

## Mentioning people and teams

You can mention a person or team on GitHub by typing @ plus their username or team name. This will trigger a notification and bring their attention to the conversation. People will also receive a notification if you edit a comment to mention their username or team name.
